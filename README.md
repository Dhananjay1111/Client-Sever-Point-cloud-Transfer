# Client-Sever-Point-cloud-Transfer
WebSocket is a system communication protocol, providing channels over single or multiple connections. With WebSocket, it possible to have data sent to another system with higher computation power and receive back the output. In the current scenario, the point cloud can be sent to the server from the client system for further processes. The server can process the received point cloud and sent it back to the client. Point cloud data can be of large volume; it is therefore serialized into binary code for easy transfer. The server receives the data and deserializes it for further process. This deserialized point cloud can be processed on the serverâ€™s GPU and VRAM, and a processed point cloud is saved at the server. This processed point cloud is the final output of the point cloud processing, which needs to be returned to the client. The server again serializes the new point cloud and transfer it to the client. On the client-side, it again needs to be deserialized for visualization and to bring it to its original format. Sending the data from client to server and receiving the data back from the server is a standard process, but what kind of process can be performed on the point cloud depends on the function available on the server. If multiple functionalities are available at the server, the client can choose the preferred process on the point cloud. This process can be anything such as tiling the point cloud, segmentation, or even deploying the pre-trained deep learning model on unclassified data.
